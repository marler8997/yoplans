 Use Case Format
=================================================

1. Give it a name

	- Use meaningful verbs
	- Use Present tense
	- Don't identify the actor in the name

2. Define the 'Actors'
	- i.e. User, Business, Admin, Organizer, YoPlans, etc...

3. Give it a 'Description'

4. Write down all 'Assumptions' (optional)
	- i.e. This use case does not deal with ...

	- What has to happen before this use case can occur?
	
8. Postconditions (optional)

 Tips
=================================================
1. Use cases don't have to be perfect, they are meant to be refined
2. Define the 'Happy Path' use cases first
3. Identify 'Re-use' opportunitys for Sub-Use Cases
4. Create a "Use Case Index"
	Use Case Name		Primary Actor		Complexity		Priority
	Place a bid			Buyer				High			1
	Create Account		User				Medium			1
	...
