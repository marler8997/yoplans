<h1> SQL Injection? </h1>
<p>
  It appears you are trying to 'hack' this site using Sql injection.
  We suspect this because we found a single quote in one of your input fields or cookies. 
  All of our database queries using single-quotes (as opposed to double-quotes) to delimit values.
  Therefore, if any input fields contain single quotes then the request is rejected.
